      <p>Since I couldn‚Äôt write a love letter and send it to you like I planned, I thought maybe I should do it but make it a website. So here we are, and I hope you‚Äôre ready to READ.</p>
      <p>I don‚Äôt even know where to start with you. Since the day I met you, I just felt immediate attraction and I really wanted to know you more. I remember back then years ago when we both were in a dark place in life, but we could always turn to each other to forget everything and smile at our conversations that were usually just you bullying me, sharing music, or having some deep talks very late at night. The very first time we interacted was me sliding in your DM‚Äôs and sending some out-of-pocket meme and since then we‚Äôve been inseparable for about 6 years. Inseparable because like you once said, we always find a way to find each other again even if you need to take a decade long break from everything.</p>
      <p>We were tight before but this past year we‚Äôve been locked the fuck in. You are the favorite thing about last year, and in general, throughout all the ups and downs. I talk shit a lot about you disappearing or ‚Äúhating me‚Äù, but I need you to know that I NEVER doubt how much you care and love for me. I‚Äôm a big overthinker and silently I overthink things like that sometimes and second guess. But that‚Äôs never the case with you because you make me feel so secure in our connection. You say all the right things and communicate with me, many would say this is a bare minimum but the bare minimum ain‚Äôt so common nowadays, but still, it shows how much you respect me and value what we have. My biggest supporter yet also the main character in my life, Leini, you put a supercharged battery in my back. You make me realize that I really can accomplish anything and the shit I do should not go unnoticed. I remember saying I‚Äôm just a regular guy, but genuinely that can‚Äôt be true cause someone like you doesn‚Äôt like some ‚Äúregular guy‚Äù someone like you liking me must make me some sort of superhero or something because in my eyes you are the most brilliant, strong, smart, BEAUTIFUL woman (INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 1000000%) in the world.</p>
      <p>Our first time doing something together was reading Fourth Wing and maybe that‚Äôs why I like the book so damn much. We are so much better than Vi and Xaden but we‚Äôre both bonded just like those mutha suckas and I don‚Äôt even need to read your intentions to gain an advantage. Our COD ranked games were almost as intense as the way I would make you feel before sleeping late at night, but they were so enjoyable. The way we compliment each other in different ways always amazes me. WWHF really showed me how well we work as a team because that game takes a lot more than just being good at puzzles. Those were just some of the many highlights with you, but I never thought I would be so happy to be someone‚Äôs love.</p>
      <p>Why do I like Leini? Some fun facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your laugh and confusion when I say something wild to you.</li>
        <li>The way you like to talk shit just because my reaction makes you laugh.</li>
        <li>Going out your way to spend time with me even if it means sacrificing your sleep sometimes.</li>
        <li>You‚Äôve been through so much bullshit yet here you are full of love and that‚Äôs a reason I think you‚Äôre the strongest.</li>
        <li>MAKING ME LEAVE MY OWN PARTY BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO SAY BYE FIRST. ACTING LIKE YOU WONT MISS ME AND THEN SAYING THAT‚ÄôS FOR ME TO KNOW. TRYING TO BULLY ME IN GAME AND BEING HARDHEADED AF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO GET A REACTION OUT OF ME. MENTIONING HOW WE‚ÄôRE DIVORCED OR WHATEVER WHEN YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME. I LOVE IT ALL AND WOULDN‚ÄôT EXCHANGE IT FOR ANYTHING OR ANYMORE.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I hope one day we can be together because I think it could really be something special. But if we can‚Äôt then this connection that we have will always be one that I look back on and have no regrets. You‚Äôre the reason I sleep with a smile and wake up and think of you first. Your laugh and the way I know you‚Äôre smiling when we talk make me so damn happy. Your presence brings so much joy into my heart even if we‚Äôre just sitting down and playing Plato. Every serious convo we‚Äôve had that made us both sad momentarily but still came out happy that we talked about it, those moments I could never forget. Thank God, the stars, our ancestors even! For making it possible for us to be in each other‚Äôs lives and no matter what happens we always find a way back, forever will.</p>
      <p>I love you so much, Kanani!</p>
      <p>Ps. If you want to... you know, be mine I have a resume you can review</p>
